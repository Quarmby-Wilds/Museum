                    <h3>Dr. Hanae Mori</h3>
                    <h4>Founding Director & Lead Archaeologist</h4>
                    <h4>Professional Bio:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Hanae Mori earned her Ph.D. in Archaeology from the University of Tokyo and completed advanced training in heritage conservation at the University of Cambridge. A specialist in prehistoric settlement archaeology, she has led excavations across Hokkaido and northern Honshu. Skilled in stratigraphic analysis, artifact conservation, and 3D site mapping, she combines traditional field notebooks with cutting-edge LIDAR and photogrammetry. Known for her meticulous yet visionary style, Dr. Mori still sketches finds by hand before committing them to digital form, grounding science in the human gesture.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Museum Role:</h4>
                    <p>
                        As founding director, Dr. Mori oversees both research and exhibition development. She curates the museum's narrative framework, ensuring every gallery connects rigorous scholarship with emotional storytelling. She also mentors early-career archaeologists and continues active fieldwork each summer.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Recipient of the Japan Foundation's Cultural Heritage Fellowship, Dr. Mori is celebrated for integrating Indigenous perspectives into national heritage policy. A Jōmon figurine she unearthed early in her career reshaped her philosophy of archaeology: “We don't just recover objects — we restore relationships.”

                    <h3>Dr. Daniel Ishikawa</h3>
                    <h4>Curator of Anthropology</h4>
                    <h4>Professional Bio:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Ishikawa holds dual doctorates in Anthropology and Linguistics from Kyoto University and the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. Fluent in Japanese, Okinawan, and English, he specializes in island cultures, oral transmission, and cultural resilience. His work combines ethnographic interviewing, archival translation, and drone-based landscape documentation. Colleagues describe his approach as intuitive, empathetic, and deeply human, often guided by sound — from waves to chants — as much as by words.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Museum Role:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Daniel curates the museum's Ryukyu Kingdom and Ainu cultural galleries. He leads field documentation of ongoing traditions and manages the oral history program, preserving the living voices of Japan's diverse communities.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Of mixed Ryukyuan and mainland heritage, Daniel bridges cultural worlds both personally and professionally. His award-winning ethnographic film Tides Remember was recognized for innovation in visual anthropology. He believes that “truth in history is not singular — it's the harmony of many voices.”

                    <h3>Keiko Tanaka</h3>
                    <h4>Collections Manager</h4>
                    <h4>Professional Bio:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Keiko Tanaka earned her M.A. in Museum Studies from Waseda University and trained in artifact conservation at the Tokyo National Research Institute for Cultural Properties. Her expertise includes cataloging, micro-cleaning, and environmental monitoring. Skilled with both precision instruments and handcrafted Japanese brushes, Keiko is known for her quiet precision and unwavering care in preserving fragile objects.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Museum Role:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Keiko oversees the storage, preservation, and digital cataloging of more than 15,000 items in the museum's collection. She mentors conservation interns and manages the integration of 3D scanning and AR archiving for public access.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Living with mild hearing loss, Keiko advocates for accessibility in museum design and has pioneered tactile exhibit guides for visitors with sensory differences. Her proudest restoration — a tiny clay bead once mistaken for debris — reminds her daily that “even the smallest artifact can carry an entire life story.”

                    <h3>Rika Sato</h3>
                    <h4>Community Outreach & Education Coordinator</h4>
                    <h4>Professional Bio:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Rika holds a B.Ed. in Cultural Education from Hokkaido University and a postgraduate certificate in Public History from the University of British Columbia. A creative educator with skills in curriculum design and experiential learning, she is known for her enthusiastic, empathetic, and inventive approach to cultural engagement. Rika often combines analog tools like clay replicas with digital AR tours to make history tactile and memorable.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Museum Role:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Rika designs and leads all public education programs, from school visits to community storytelling projects. She coordinates local volunteers for excavation days and curates “Community Voices,” a rotating exhibition of heritage stories submitted by the public.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations:</h4>
                    <p>
                        A descendant of postwar Hokkaido settlers, Rika believes every family archive holds part of Japan's wider story. Her Ministry of Education-funded project History in Our Hands brings archaeological learning into classrooms nationwide. Her favorite teaching piece — a Jōmon clay pot marked by ancient fingerprints — reminds her that “the past always leaves a touch.”

                    <h3>Yuki Nakamura</h3>
                    <h4>Cultural Historian</h4>
                    <h4>Professional Bio:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Yuki Nakamura earned their Ph.D. in Cultural History from Kyoto University, followed by postdoctoral research at Leiden University. Their work bridges semiotics and decolonial museology, exploring how meaning is shaped through Japan's layered encounters with trade, power, and myth. Before joining Hidden Histories, Yuki collaborated with the Edo-Tokyo Museum and the Rijksmuseum Volkenkunde on cross-cultural exhibitions about symbolism in textiles and travel journals. Drawn to artifacts that merge text and touch — scrolls, amulets, and trade letters — they call themselves a translator of silences, attuned to what history omits as much as what it preserves. A reflective provocateur, Yuki treats interpretation as both scholarship and quiet activism.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Museum Role:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yuki turns evidence into insight through comparative and participatory interpretation. They cross-reference written sources with oral memory archives, map trade routes with digital tools, and collaborate with artists to reanimate forgotten narratives. Their exhibits treat artifacts as “conversations in motion,” often pairing Edo-period texts with modern community voices to question who defines the past and how.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Of Okinawan heritage and fluent in Japanese, Dutch, and Ainu, Yuki challenges nationalized histories by centering peripheral and maritime cultures. An advocate for counter-colonial storytelling, they advise the museum's Ethics Council on repatriation and cultural consent. Yuki often asks whether museums can ever be neutral, noting that “to display is to declare allegiance.” Translating a merchant's journal once shifted their view of truth: empathy, not certainty, is the historian's highest form of accuracy.
