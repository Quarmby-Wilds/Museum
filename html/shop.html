                        <b>Description: </b>A limited-edition ceramic pendant inspired by the spiral and flame motifs of Jōmon Roots, hand-shaped by contemporary artisans in Aomori. Each piece is slightly different — no two swirls are alike — echoing the individuality of the prehistoric cord-marked vessels that inspired it. Comes in a recycled rice-paper box with museum seal and story card.<br><br>
